# eSIM Travel Tips and Best Practices

## Before Your Trip

### Planning Your eSIM Purchase

**1-2 Weeks Before Departure:**

✅ **Research Destination Coverage**
- Check which carriers operate in your destination
- Verify network quality and coverage maps
- Read reviews from other travelers

✅ **Determine Data Needs**
- Estimate daily data usage
- Consider activities: navigation, social media, video calls, streaming
- Typical usage:
  - Light (1-2 GB/day): Messaging, maps, browsing
  - Medium (3-5 GB/day): Social media, photos, video calls
  - Heavy (7-10 GB/day): Streaming, video content, hotspot

✅ **Compare Plan Options**
- **Local eSIM**: Single country, usually cheapest
- **Regional eSIM**: Multiple countries in one region
- **Global eSIM**: Worldwide coverage, most expensive

✅ **Check Device Compatibility**
- Verify your device supports eSIM
- Update to latest OS version
- Ensure device is carrier-unlocked

### Choosing the Right Plan
