# eSIM Coverage and Network Information

## Understanding eSIM Coverage

### How eSIM Coverage Works

**Network Partnerships:**
- eSIM providers partner with local carriers worldwide
- Your eSIM connects to partner networks in each country
- Automatic network selection in most cases
- Same coverage as local subscribers on those networks

**Coverage Types:**
- **Urban Areas**: Excellent coverage, high speeds
- **Suburban Areas**: Good coverage, reliable connectivity
- **Rural Areas**: Variable, depends on local infrastructure
- **Remote Areas**: Limited or no coverage

### Coverage Terminology

**Network Types:**
- **5G**: Fastest, newest technology (where available)
- **4G LTE**: Fast, widely available, standard for travel
- **3G**: Slower, being phased out in many countries
- **2G**: Very slow, only for emergencies

**Signal Strength:**
- ******* (5 bars): Excellent
- ****** (4 bars): Good
- ***** (3 bars): Fair, usable
- **** (2 bars): Weak, may be slow
- *** (1 bar): Very weak, may disconnect

**Coverage Indicators:**
- **LTE**: Connected to 4G network
- **5G/5G+/5G UW**: Connected to 5G network
- **3G**: Connected to 3G (slower)
- **E** (EDGE): 2G, very slow
- **No Service**: Out of coverage area

- Usually optimal for most users

**When it's Enabled:**
- Default setting for most eSIMs
- No configuration needed

### Manual Network Selection

**When to Use Manual Selection:**
- Automatic selection not working
- Slow speeds on current network
- Want to try different carrier
- Specific network has better coverage in your area

**How to Manually Select:**

**iPhone:**
1. Settings > Cellular > [eSIM]
2. Tap "Network Selection"
3. Turn OFF "Automatic"
4. Wait for networks to appear (30 seconds)
5. Select desired network
6. Test connection

**Android:**
1. Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs > [eSIM]
2. Tap "Network operators"
3. Turn OFF "Select automatically"
4. Choose from available networks
5. Test connection

**Tips:**
- Try largest/primary carrier in country
- Compare speeds on different networks
- Switch back to automatic if having issues
- Takes 1-2 minutes to register on new network

### Network Priority

**eSIM Provider Network Agreements:**
- **Primary networks**: Best speeds, priority access
- **Secondary networks**: Backup, may be slower
- **Roaming partners**: Additional coverage areas

**Usually Connect To:**
- Largest/main carrier in country first
- Automatically switch if signal lost
- May not access all carriers (depends on agreements)

ð¡ **Check Coverage Before Booking**: Verify eSIM covers your specific destination

ð¡ **Multiple Networks**: Choose eSIM providers with multiple partner networks

ð¡ **Test Immediately**: Activate and test eSIM while still at home/in coverage area

ð¡ **Manual Selection**: If automatic isn't working, try manual network selection

ð¡ **Backup Plan**: Have hotel/accommodation info downloaded, not just on cloud

ð¡ **OpenSignal App**: Download to find best network in your current location

ð¡ **Airplane Mode Trick**: When network switching between countries, toggle airplane mode to force reconnection

ð¡ **Time Zones**: When crossing borders, check if device time/timezone updated (affects some network authentication)

## Summary

- **Always check coverage maps** before purchasing
- **Urban areas**: Excellent coverage worldwide
- **Rural/remote**: Variable, plan accordingly
- **Regional eSIMs**: Best for multi-country trips
- **Download offline content**: Don't rely solely on cellular
- **Multiple networks**: Look for providers with multiple partner carriers
- **Test early**: Activate and test as soon as possible
