# What is an eSIM?

## Overview

An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM card that is built directly into your device. Unlike traditional physical SIM cards that you insert into your phone, an eSIM is embedded in the device's hardware and can be programmed remotely.

## Key Features

### Digital Technology
- **No Physical Card**: eSIMs eliminate the need for a physical SIM card slot
- **Remote Activation**: Can be activated and configured over-the-air (OTA)
- **Multiple Profiles**: Store multiple carrier profiles on a single eSIM
- **Instant Setup**: Activate your plan in minutes without waiting for a physical card

### How It Works

1. **Purchase**: Buy an eSIM plan from a provider
2. **Receive QR Code**: Get a QR code or activation code via email
3. **Scan & Activate**: Scan the QR code with your device's camera
4. **Connect**: Your device connects to the network automatically

## Benefits of eSIM

### For Travelers
- **No Roaming Fees**: Avoid expensive international roaming charges
- **Instant Connectivity**: Get connected as soon as you land
- **Multiple Numbers**: Keep your home number while using a local data plan
- **Convenience**: No need to find local SIM card vendors

### For General Users
- **Flexibility**: Switch between carriers without changing SIM cards
- **Dual SIM**: Use two phone numbers on one device
- **Space Saving**: Allows for slimmer device designs
- **Environmental**: Reduces plastic waste from physical SIM cards
