## Travel eSIM Questions

### Do I need to activate my eSIM before I travel?

**Answer:** It depends on your plan and preferences.

**Option 1: Activate Before Departure** ✅
- **Pros:** Test it works, immediate connection on arrival
- **Cons:** Plan might start counting days from activation

**Option 2: Activate Upon Arrival** ✅
- **Pros:** Maximize plan duration, no wasted days
- **Cons:** Need airport Wi-Fi to activate
- **Best for:** Plans with fixed start date

**Recommendation:** Check your plan's terms. If it starts on first data use (not purchase), activating at home is safe.

---

### Will my eSIM work in multiple countries?

**Answer:** Depends on the plan type:

**Local eSIM:** ❌ Single country only
- Example: "Japan eSIM" works only in Japan
- Cheapest option for single-destination travel

**Regional eSIM:** ✅ Multiple countries in one region
- Example: "Europe eSIM" works in 30+ European countries
- Seamless roaming across covered countries
- No need to switch SIMs at borders

**Global eSIM:** ✅ Many countries worldwide
- Example: Works in 100+ countries across all continents

**Check coverage:** Always verify your specific destinations are included in the plan.

---

### What's the difference between data-only and voice plans?

**Answer:**

**Data-Only Plans** (Most Common)

**Answer:** Yes, with Dual SIM setup!

**Configuration:**
1. Keep physical home SIM in device
2. Add travel eSIM for data
